            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>To start with front-end development you'll need to learn HTML so with that being said, 
                you'll need Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Create a new file, type in HTML, and select it from the options.</p>
            
            <h3>Steps to Create a Basic HTML Structure:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Open Visual Studio Code:</strong> Launch the application after installation.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a New File:</strong> Click on <code>File > New File</code> to open a blank document.</li>
                <li><strong>Save the File as HTML:</strong> Save the new file by clicking <code>File > Save As</code> and name it <code>index.html</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Type the Basic HTML Structure:</strong> In your new file, enter ! to get the following code:</li>
            </ol>
            
            <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: Declares the document type as HTML5.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code>: Starts the HTML document and sets the language to English.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code>: Contains meta-information like character set and title.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code>: Ensures the page is responsive on mobile devices.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;</code>: Sets the title of the page, displayed in the browser tab.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code>: Contains the visible content of the page.</li>
                <li><code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>: Closes the HTML document.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Once you've typed this code, save the file. You can then open <code>index.html</code> in your browser to see your first HTML page in action. Note that it is still empty because we haven't added any content yet. To add more content, check this page for <a href="frontenddev.html">further instructions</a>.</p>

            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>Python is a versatile programming language used for various applications, from web development to data science. Similarly to front-end development, we'll use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Python programming.</p>
        
            <h3>Key Concepts to Get Started:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Store information that can be used and modified later in your code.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Types:</strong> Python supports various data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.</li>
                <li><strong>Imports:</strong> Allows you to include and use external libraries or modules in your program.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Syntax:</strong> Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, making it easy to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> Use `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to control the flow of your program.</li>
                <li><strong>Loops:</strong> Repeat actions using `for` and `while` loops.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Examples:</h3>
        
            <h4>Variables and Data Types</h4>
            <pre><code># Variables
greeting = "Hello, World!"  # String
age = 25                    # Integer
pi = 3.14                   # Float
is_python_fun = True        # Boolean

print(greeting)
print("Age:", age)
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Is Python fun?", is_python_fun)</code></pre>
        
            <h4>Imports</h4>
            <pre><code># Importing the math module to use mathematical functions
import math

# Using an imported function
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0</code></pre>
        
            <h4>Control Structures</h4>
            <pre><code># Using if-else statements
number = 10

if number > 5:
    print("The number is greater than 5")
else:
    print("The number is 5 or less")</code></pre>
        
            <h4>Loops</h4>
            <pre><code># Using a for loop
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration:", i)

# Using a while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1</code></pre>

            <h2>Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a versatile programming language used in a wide range of applications, including the popular game Minecraft. There is also a programming language known as GameMaker Language (GML) that shares similarities with Java. In this tutorial, we'll use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to get started with Java programming.</p>
            
            <h3>Getting Started with Java</h3>
            <p>To begin programming in Java, follow these steps to set up your development environment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Install the Java Development Kit (JDK):</strong> Download and install the JDK from the official <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html" target="_blank">Oracle website</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code):</strong> Download and install VS Code from its official <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Set Up Java Extensions in VS Code:</strong> Enhance your Java development experience by installing the “Java Extension Pack” from the VS Code marketplace.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Basic Java Concepts</h3>
            <p>Here are some fundamental concepts to get you started with Java programming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Store data that can be used and manipulated in your code.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Types:</strong> Java has several data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.</li>
                <li><strong>Control Flow:</strong> Use <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>switch</code> statements to control the flow of your program.</li>
                <li><strong>Loops:</strong> Repeat actions using <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.</li>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Define reusable blocks of code. Methods can accept parameters and return values.</li>
                <li><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> Java is an object-oriented language. Learn to create classes and objects to model real-world entities.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Variables and Data Types</h4>
            <p>Variables are used to store data. Here's an example:</p>
            <pre><code>public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String greeting = "Hello, Java!";  // String
        int age = 30;                      // Integer
        double pi = 3.14159;              // Floating-point number
        boolean isJavaFun = true;         // Boolean
        
        System.out.println(greeting);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Value of pi: " + pi);
        System.out.println("Is Java fun? " + isJavaFun);
    }
}</code></pre>
        
            <h4>Control Flow</h4>
            <p>Control the flow of your program with conditional statements:</p>
            <pre><code>public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;
        
        if (number > 5) {
            System.out.println("The number is greater than 5");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is 5 or less");
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
        
            <h4>Loops</h4>
            <p>Use loops to repeat actions:</p>
            <pre><code>public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // For loop
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
        }
        
        // While loop
        int count = 0;
        while (count < 5) {
            System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
            count++;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
        
            <p>These examples cover basic Java syntax. For more advanced topics, 
                such as object-oriented programming and exception handling, refer to this page for <a href="java_advanced.html">further instructions</a>.</p>

            <h2>My Journey in Development</h2>
            <p>Front-end development and game development might seem daunting at first, but once you grasp the basics, it all becomes much easier. The key is to get your mind and logic into the code. If it works, it works—sometimes it feels like "witchcraft" because we don't always know why it works, but that's part of the magic.</p>
            <p>Creating games has always been a dream of mine, and when I finally tried it, I found it incredibly fun. If you're interested, you can check out one of my games, <a href="https://gx.games/games/i01ux5/rock-go-boom/tracks/02571171-bfdf-437a-94a1-bfa0167de342" target="_blank" class="game-link">Rock Go Boom</a>, on GX.games. I update the game whenever I have the time, so be sure to check back for new features and improvements!</p>
            <p>Coding might seem difficult at first, but it's not as hard as it looks. Just give it a try, and you'll find that it starts to flow naturally. Keep experimenting, and don't be afraid to make mistakes—it's all part of the learning process.</p>
            <p>All of us start off not knowing much, but it's our creativity that shapes who we become, making us unique. In the end, we all live to create while we can, so make as much as you can—because we never know when our time will be up.</p>
